## Purpose

<!-- Reason for the PR (solves an issue/problem, adds a feature, etc) -->

## Rationale

<!-- How did you come to this conclusion as the solution? What was your
reasoning? What were you trying to do? -->

## How did you test?

<!-- Where are your unit tests? How did you verify this solution? -->

## How to Verify

<!-- List of steps to validate your PR -->

<!-- I prefer Test Driven Development (TDD) or BDD so ideally you have added to
the unit test suite to prove it was a problem before and now the problem is
solved -->

<!-- EXAMPLE Steps
1. Fetch this branch

   ```sh
   git remote add <fork_name> <fork_url.git>
   git fetch <fork_name>
   # start from master at base of branch
   git checkout $(git merge-base master <fork_name/branch>)
   ```

2. Grab relevant test files & pkgs

    ```sh
    git checkout <fork_name/branch> -- path/to/testfile(s)
    npm install
    ```

3. `npm test`. You will see # of tests will fail without this fix
4. Review & validate the test cases written to understand what scenarios are
   fixed.
5. Checkout the full branch to include the fix

    ```sh
    git checkout --detach <fork_name/branch>
    ```

6. Run `npm test` again. All tests will pass verifying there was no regression
   and the buggy scenarios were fixed.
